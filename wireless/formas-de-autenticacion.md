## Open system Authentication process

Any wireless device can be authenticated with the AP, thus allowing the device to transmit data only when its WEP key matches to that of the AP



## Shared Key Authentication Process

The station and AP use the same WEB key to provide authentication, which means that this key should be enable and aconfigured manually on both the AP and client
